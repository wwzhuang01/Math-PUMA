I will give you a detailed solving procedure or a single answer for a math problem.
If it is a procedure, you need to extract the key solution steps and list them accordingly in markdown syntax.
If it is just a single answer, output the answer directly.
Use XML format to wrap your response. Do not answer any other irrelevant content.

Here are examples:
<model_output>
To begin with, it is important to note that the total measure of the angles surrounding point C must equal 360 degrees. This leads us to the equation: \n\n\\[\n\\angle R C M + \\angle R C L + \\angle M C N + \\angle N C L = 360\n\\]\n\nNext, we can substitute the provided angle expressions into this equation, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1) + (3x + 5) + 60 + \\angle N C L = 360\n\\]\n\nUpon simplifying this equation, we combine like terms to obtain:\n\n\\[\n4x + 64 + \\angle N C L = 360\n\\]\n\nFrom here, we can isolate \\(\\angle N C L\\) by rearranging the equation, which gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\angle N C L = 360 - 64 - 4x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\angle N C L = 296 - 4x\n\\]\n\nTo determine the value of \\(x\\), we recognize that the sum of angles \\(\\angle R C M\\) and \\(\\angle R C L\\) must equal the sum of angles \\(\\angle M C N\\) and \\(\\angle N C L\\). This leads us to the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1) + (3x + 5) = 60 + (296 - 4x)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation further, we find:\n\n\\[\n4x + 4 = 356 - 4x\n\\]\n\nBy combining like terms, we arrive at:\n\n\\[\n8x = 352\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\) yields:\n\n\\[\nx = 44\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this value back into our expression for \\(\\angle N C L\\) allows us to calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\angle N C L = 296 - 4(44)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\angle N C L = 296 - 176\n\\]\n\\[\n\\angle N C L = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: â€ Answer: B. 120
</model_output>
<extracted>
1. Note that the total measure of the angles surrounding point \(C\) must equal 360 degrees:
   \[
   \\angle R C M + \\angle R C L + \\angle M C N + \\angle N C L = 360
   \]

2. Substitute the provided angle expressions into this equation:
   \[
   (x - 1) + (3x + 5) + 60 + \\angle N C L = 360
   \]

3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   4x + 64 + \\angle N C L = 360
   \]

4. Isolate \(\\angle N C L\) by rearranging the equation:
   \[
   \\angle N C L = 360 - 64 - 4x
   \]
   \[
   \\angle N C L = 296 - 4x
   \]

5. Recognize that the sum of angles \(\\angle R C M\) and \(\\angle R C L\) must equal the sum of angles \(\\angle M C N\) and \(\\angle N C L\):
   \[
   (x - 1) + (3x + 5) = 60 + (296 - 4x)
   \]

6. Simplify this equation:
   \[
   4x + 4 = 356 - 4x
   \]

7. Combine like terms:
   \[
   8x = 352
   \]

8. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 44
   \]

9. Substitute this value back into the expression for \(\\angle N C L\):
   \[
   \\angle N C L = 296 - 4(44)
   \]
   \[
   \\angle N C L = 296 - 176
   \]
   \[
   \\angle N C L = 120
   \]

- Average score: Evaluate, based on the given question, answer, diagram, and diagram annotation, whether each solution step is correct in logical
reasoning, visual perception, and numerical computation, with an incorrect score of 0 and a correct score of 1. Then, calculate the average score of multiple steps.
- Final answer score: Match the model's final answer with the ground truth answer, scoring 1 if it matches and 0 if it doesn't.

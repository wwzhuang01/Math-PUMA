Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\""

The height of a parallelogram is the perpendicular segment drawn from a point on one side to the opposite side, and this segment is called the height of the parallelogram.\n6. To draw a parallelogram, first draw two parallel and equal-length line segments, then connect the endpoints of these two segments to form a quadrilateral."

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle.

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

It can be described by three elements: the center of rotation, the direction of rotation, and the angle of rotation.\n2. The distances from corresponding points to the center of rotation are equal.\n3. The angle between the line segment connecting corresponding points and the center of rotation equals the angle of rotation.\n4. The figures before and after rotation are congruent, meaning their size and shape remain unchanged.\n5. The center of rotation is the unique fixed point."

Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4.

For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\""

        "knowledge concept description": "Tessellation of Figures:\n1. Tiling, or tessellation of a plane, refers to the process of covering a plane using one or more types of shapes that are identical in size and shape, without leaving any gaps or overlapping.\n2. Common shapes for tiling: square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram, regular hexagon.\n3. The sum of the angles at each vertex point of the tiling must equal a full angle (360°). A plane can only be tiled if the sum of the angles at each vertex point equals a full angle.\n4. Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, using several congruent triangles, each angle can be used twice to form a full angle, so triangles can always tile a plane.\n5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°, and at each vertex point of the tiling, the four angles just form a full angle, so any quadrilateral can tile a plane.\n6. Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120°, and they can also form a full angle, so regular hexagons can tile a plane."

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

Representation of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair consists of two numbers, with the first number representing the position on the horizontal axis (column) and the second number representing the position on the vertical axis (row). For example, the ordered pair (2, 4) represents the position in column 2, row 4.\n2. Method of Determining Position: To find a position based on an ordered pair, first identify a reference point on the plane. Then move horizontally according to the first number in the ordered pair, and move vertically according to the second number. The final position reached is the point represented by the ordered pair.\nUnderstanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

A line is perpendicular to another line if the angle between them is 90 degrees. Similarly, a line is perpendicular to a plane if it forms a 90-degree angle with any line lying in that plane.\n3. The perpendicular segment from a point to a line is the shortest distance from the point to the line.\n4. From a given point on a line and a point not on the line, only one perpendicular line can be drawn to the given line."

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

When two or more figures are combined to form a new geometric figure, its area equals the sum of the areas of the original figures, but the perimeter will be shorter than the sum of the perimeters of the original figures. If the total length of the joined edges is a, then the decrease in the perimeter after joining is 2a.\nConversion Rates and Calculations Between Length Units:\n1. Conversion Rates between Length Units: 1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters (m); 1 meter (m) = 10 decimeters (dm); 1 decimeter (dm) = 10 centimeters (cm); 1 centimeter (cm) = 10 millimeters (mm); 1 millimeter (mm) = 1000 nanometers (nm)\n2. Converting between Different Units: To convert from a larger unit to a smaller unit, multiply by the conversion rate. To convert from a smaller unit to a larger unit, divide by the conversion rate.\n3. To convert kilometers to meters: multiply by 1000.\n4. To convert meters to decimeters: multiply by 10.\n5. To convert decimeters to centimeters: multiply by 10.\n6. To convert centimeters to millimeters: multiply by 10.\n7. To convert millimeters to nanometers: multiply by 1000.\n8. To convert nanometers to millimeters: divide by 1000.\n9. To convert millimeters to centimeters: divide by 10.\n10. To convert centimeters to decimeters: divide by 10.\n11.

If the total length of the dividing lines is a, then the increase in the perimeter after division is 2a.\nUnderstanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

A plane can only be tiled if the sum of the angles at each vertex point equals a full angle.\n4. Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, using several congruent triangles, each angle can be used twice to form a full angle, so triangles can always tile a plane.\n5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°, and at each vertex point of the tiling, the four angles just form a full angle, so any quadrilateral can tile a plane.\n6.

A trapezoid with one leg perpendicular to the bases is called a right trapezoid.\n3. A trapezoid with both legs equal in length is called an isosceles trapezoid.\n4. The height of a trapezoid is the distance between the upper base and the lower base."

Obtuse triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is greater than 90 degrees.\n3. By side classification: Scalene triangle: A triangle where all three sides are of different lengths. Isosceles triangle: A triangle with two equal sides. Equilateral triangle: A triangle with all three sides equal.\n4. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle in a plane is 180 degrees.\n5. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and the difference between the lengths of any two sides is less than the length of the third side.\n6. The height of a triangle is the perpendicular line segment drawn from a vertex to the opposite side.\n7. To draw the height of a triangle: Choose one side as the base. Find the vertex opposite the base. Using a ruler and compass, draw a perpendicular line from the vertex to the base. Ensure to mark the right angle symbol, indicating it is the height.\n8. Once the lengths of the three sides of a triangle are determined, the triangle is fixed. The angles and the area enclosed by the three sides do not change."

Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\""

Among all the lines connecting two points, the line segment is the shortest.\nDescribing Simple Routes Based on Direction and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\""

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle.

The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair."

By angle classification: Acute triangle: All three interior angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees. Right triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is exactly 90 degrees. Obtuse triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is greater than 90 degrees.\n3. By side classification: Scalene triangle: A triangle where all three sides are of different lengths. Isosceles triangle: A triangle with two equal sides. Equilateral triangle: A triangle with all three sides equal.\n4. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle in a plane is 180 degrees.\n5. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and the difference between the lengths of any two sides is less than the length of the third side.\n6. The height of a triangle is the perpendicular line segment drawn from a vertex to the opposite side.\n7. To draw the height of a triangle: Choose one side as the base. Find the vertex opposite the base. Using a ruler and compass, draw a perpendicular line from the vertex to the base. Ensure to mark the right angle symbol, indicating it is the height.\n8. Once the lengths of the three sides of a triangle are determined, the triangle is fixed. The angles and the area enclosed by the three sides do not change.\nDetermining the Positions of Objects Based on Direction, Angle, and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2. Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\""

To draw a parallelogram, first draw two parallel and equal-length line segments, then connect the endpoints of these two segments to form a quadrilateral.\nRepresenting Positions Using Ordered Pairs:\n1. Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair."

Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2. Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\""

A plane can only be tiled if the sum of the angles at each vertex point equals a full angle.\n4. Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, using several congruent triangles, each angle can be used twice to form a full angle, so triangles can always tile a plane.\n5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°, and at each vertex point of the tiling, the four angles just form a full angle, so any quadrilateral can tile a plane.\n6. Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120°, and they can also form a full angle, so regular hexagons can tile a plane."

Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair.\nTranslation:\n1. Translation refers to the movement of all points of a figure in the same plane by the same distance in a given direction. This type of motion is called translation of the figure.\n2. Translation does not change the shape, size, or orientation of the figure.\n3. The shape and size of the figure remain unchanged after translation; only the position changes.\n4. After translation, the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\n5. Multiple consecutive translations are equivalent to a single translation.\n6. A figure after an even number of symmetries is equivalent to the figure after a translation.\n7. Translation is determined by direction and distance.\n8. After translation, corresponding line segments are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length, corresponding angles are equal, and the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length."

Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2. Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\""

Full angle > straight angle > obtuse angle > right angle > acute angle.\nUnderstanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

This formula indicates that the volume of a cone is one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height.\n2.

A circle is an axisymmetric figure.\n3. The center of the circle is called the center, usually denoted by the letter O. A line segment connecting the center to any point on the circle is called the radius, usually denoted by the letter r.\n4. A line segment that passes through the center and has its endpoints on the circle is called the diameter, usually denoted by the letter d. The diameter is the longest line segment within the circle, and it is twice the length of the radius.\n5. All radii of a circle are equal in length, and all diameters are equal in length.\n6. Method of drawing a circle: Use a compass. The distance between the legs of the compass represents the radius. After setting the center and the radius, rotate the compass to draw a circle."

The circumference of a circle = diameter × pi (C = πd) or the circumference of a circle = 2 × radius × pi (C = 2πr).\n3. The circumference of a semicircle can be calculated using the formula C = πr + 2r.\n4. In the same circle or congruent circles, there are an infinite number of radii and an infinite number of diameters. All radii and diameters in the same circle are equal. The length of the diameter is twice the length of the radius, and the length of the radius is half the length of the diameter."

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

Tiling, or tessellation of a plane, refers to the process of covering a plane using one or more types of shapes that are identical in size and shape, without leaving any gaps or overlapping.\n2. Common shapes for tiling: square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram, regular hexagon.\n3. The sum of the angles at each vertex point of the tiling must equal a full angle (360°). A plane can only be tiled if the sum of the angles at each vertex point equals a full angle.\n4. Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, using several congruent triangles, each angle can be used twice to form a full angle, so triangles can always tile a plane.\n5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°, and at each vertex point of the tiling, the four angles just form a full angle, so any quadrilateral can tile a plane.\n6. Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120°, and they can also form a full angle, so regular hexagons can tile a plane."

Components of a Cylinder: A cylinder consists of bases and a lateral surface. The bases are two equal circular surfaces, referred to as the upper base and the lower base; the lateral surface is a curved surface that connects the upper and lower bases.\n3. Unfolded Lateral Surface of a Cylinder: When the lateral surface of a cylinder is unfolded, it forms a rectangle or a square. If the unfolded surface is a rectangle, its length is the circumference of the circular base, and its width is the height of the cylinder; if the unfolded surface is a square, it means the height of the cylinder is equal to the circumference of the circular base."

Find the vertex opposite the base. Using a ruler and compass, draw a perpendicular line from the vertex to the base. Ensure to mark the right angle symbol, indicating it is the height.\n8. Once the lengths of the three sides of a triangle are determined, the triangle is fixed. The angles and the area enclosed by the three sides do not change."

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\""

Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\""

A square is both a centrally symmetric figure and an axisymmetric figure (with four lines of symmetry).\nCircumference of Circles:\n1. A line segment passing through the center of a circle with both endpoints on the circle is called the diameter, usually denoted by the letter d.

Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system.

Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair.\nTranslation:\n1. Translation refers to the movement of all points of a figure in the same plane by the same distance in a given direction. This type of motion is called translation of the figure.\n2. Translation does not change the shape, size, or orientation of the figure.\n3. The shape and size of the figure remain unchanged after translation; only the position changes.\n4. After translation, the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\n5. Multiple consecutive translations are equivalent to a single translation.\n6. A figure after an even number of symmetries is equivalent to the figure after a translation.\n7. Translation is determined by direction and distance.\n8. After translation, corresponding line segments are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length, corresponding angles are equal, and the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\nRotation:\n1. The rotation of a figure involves the movement of every point on the figure in the plane around a fixed point by a fixed angle. It can be described by three elements: the center of rotation, the direction of rotation, and the angle of rotation.\n2. The distances from corresponding points to the center of rotation are equal.\n3. The angle between the line segment connecting corresponding points and the center of rotation equals the angle of rotation.\n4. The figures before and after rotation are congruent, meaning their size and shape remain unchanged.\n5. The center of rotation is the unique fixed point."

Full angle > straight angle > obtuse angle > right angle > acute angle.\nFolding Problems of Figures:\n1. The folded figure exhibits the properties of a symmetrical figure, with the fold line as the axis of symmetry, and the two parts of the figure before and after folding are symmetrical about the fold line.\nUnderstanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

In the absence of special instructions, capacity and volume can be considered the same concept, using the same units and calculation methods.\nObserving Objects:\n1. When observing an object from different angles, you will see two or three adjacent faces, and the shape observed on each face is different.\n2. The top, front, and side faces of a rectangular cubiod or cube are defined by convention. The face facing upward is called the top face, the face facing the observer is called the front face, and the two side faces are called the side faces. It is impossible to see opposite faces of a rectangular cubiod or cube at the same time.\n3. When observing a combination of objects, not only should the shape of each object be considered, but also the positional relationships between the objects. If an object is blocked by another object, the blocked part will be difficult to observe.\n4.

        "knowledge concept description": "Properties and Understanding of Trapezoids:\n1. A trapezoid (or trapezium) is a quadrilateral with only one pair of opposite sides parallel. The parallel sides are called the bases of the trapezoid: the longer base is called the lower base, and the shorter base is called the upper base; the other two sides are called the legs; the perpendicular segment between the two bases is called the height of the trapezoid.\n2. A trapezoid with one leg perpendicular to the bases is called a right trapezoid.\n3. A trapezoid with both legs equal in length is called an isosceles trapezoid.\n4. The height of a trapezoid is the distance between the upper base and the lower base.\nTessellation of Figures:\n1. Tiling, or tessellation of a plane, refers to the process of covering a plane using one or more types of shapes that are identical in size and shape, without leaving any gaps or overlapping.\n2. Common shapes for tiling: square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram, regular hexagon.\n3. The sum of the angles at each vertex point of the tiling must equal a full angle (360°). A plane can only be tiled if the sum of the angles at each vertex point equals a full angle.\n4. Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, using several congruent triangles, each angle can be used twice to form a full angle, so triangles can always tile a plane.\n5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°, and at each vertex point of the tiling, the four angles just form a full angle, so any quadrilateral can tile a plane.\n6. Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120°, and they can also form a full angle, so regular hexagons can tile a plane.\nSum of Interior Angles of Other Polygons:\n1. The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°, and the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540°.\n2. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon = 180° × (number of sides - 2).\n3. The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon = (n - 2) × 180°.\n4. A polygon with all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal is called a regular polygon."

Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\""

Representation of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair consists of two numbers, with the first number representing the position on the horizontal axis (column) and the second number representing the position on the vertical axis (row). For example, the ordered pair (2, 4) represents the position in column 2, row 4.\n2. Method of Determining Position: To find a position based on an ordered pair, first identify a reference point on the plane. Then move horizontally according to the first number in the ordered pair, and move vertically according to the second number. The final position reached is the point represented by the ordered pair.\nTranslation:\n1. Translation refers to the movement of all points of a figure in the same plane by the same distance in a given direction. This type of motion is called translation of the figure.\n2. Translation does not change the shape, size, or orientation of the figure.\n3. The shape and size of the figure remain unchanged after translation; only the position changes.\n4. After translation, the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\n5. Multiple consecutive translations are equivalent to a single translation.\n6. A figure after an even number of symmetries is equivalent to the figure after a translation.\n7. Translation is determined by direction and distance.\n8. After translation, corresponding line segments are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length, corresponding angles are equal, and the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\nDescribing Simple Routes Based on Direction and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\""

Representation of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair consists of two numbers, with the first number representing the position on the horizontal axis (column) and the second number representing the position on the vertical axis (row). For example, the ordered pair (2, 4) represents the position in column 2, row 4.\n2. Method of Determining Position: To find a position based on an ordered pair, first identify a reference point on the plane. Then move horizontally according to the first number in the ordered pair, and move vertically according to the second number. The final position reached is the point represented by the ordered pair.\nDistance Between Two Points:\n1. The line segment between two points is the shortest distance between them.\n2. In a plane, the length of the line segment with these two points as endpoints is the distance between the two points.\n3. If two lines are parallel, then the shortest distance between them is perpendicular to both lines.\nDescribing Simple Routes Based on Direction and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\""

Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair."

When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\"\nUnderstanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair."

Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair."

South is opposite to north, and west is opposite to east; northwest is opposite to southeast, and northeast is opposite to southwest.\n3. East, south, west, and north are arranged in a clockwise direction.\nRotation:\n1. The rotation of a figure involves the movement of every point on the figure in the plane around a fixed point by a fixed angle. It can be described by three elements: the center of rotation, the direction of rotation, and the angle of rotation.\n2. The distances from corresponding points to the center of rotation are equal.\n3. The angle between the line segment connecting corresponding points and the center of rotation equals the angle of rotation.\n4. The figures before and after rotation are congruent, meaning their size and shape remain unchanged.\n5. The center of rotation is the unique fixed point.\nDescribing Simple Routes Based on Direction and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\""

An expanded view of a cube is a two-dimensional representation of the cube, formed by unfolding the cube along its edges into a plane. It shows the arrangement of all six faces of the cube on the same plane.\n2. An expanded view of a cube can have different arrangements, but it usually consists of one central square surrounded by four adjacent squares, with an additional square connected to the central square. Common shapes include \"T\" shape, \"cross\" shape, and \"L\" shape.\n3. Each square in the expanded view represents one face of the cube, and every two adjacent squares in the expanded view are also adjacent faces in the cube.\n4. There are a total of 6 squares in the expanded view, and each square has equal side lengths.\nCardinal Directions (East, South, West, North):\n1.

Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2. Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\"\nUnderstanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle."

East, south, west, and north are arranged in a clockwise direction.\nCircumference of Circles:\n1. A line segment passing through the center of a circle with both endpoints on the circle is called the diameter, usually denoted by the letter d. A line segment connecting the center of the circle to any point on the circle is called the radius, usually denoted by the letter r.\n2. The circumference of a circle = diameter × pi (C = πd) or the circumference of a circle = 2 × radius × pi (C = 2πr).\n3. The circumference of a semicircle can be calculated using the formula C = πr + 2r.\n4. In the same circle or congruent circles, there are an infinite number of radii and an infinite number of diameters. All radii and diameters in the same circle are equal. The length of the diameter is twice the length of the radius, and the length of the radius is half the length of the diameter.\nArea of Circles:\n1. The area of a circle = pi × radius × radius.
